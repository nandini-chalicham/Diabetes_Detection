# Diabetes_Detection
This is a neural network project build under Tensorflow and Keras libraries.
Diabetes is an incurable disease, affects a sizable portion of the human population. It can be dangerous to one's health if it is not properly managed. As a result, early detection of diabetes is critical. By collecting the following data from the people and training the model, prediction can be tried from the input data.
1. Number of times pregnant
2. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance
3. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. Body mass index (weight in kg/ (height in m)^2)
7. Diabetes pedigree function
8. Age(years)
9. Class variable (0 or 1)

Here the input data is taken from the column 1 to 8 and the ouput is given in the form of binary which indicates 1 as yes and 0 as no.
By the above factors and terms the prediction is made and accurate ouput is given by the model.
